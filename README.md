# Pipeviewer Using Rust

**Pipeviewer** is a powerful command-line utility designed to provide real-time insights into processes and I/O operations on a Linux system. It excels in scenarios where processes, such as `tar` and others, do not inherently offer progress tracking.

With Pipeviewer, you can:

- Gain visibility into the progress of otherwise opaque processes, making it easier to monitor their status.
- Monitor data transfer rates and throughput during I/O operations, ensuring optimal system performance.
- Enhance your control and understanding of ongoing tasks, all through a simple and intuitive command-line interface.

Whether you're dealing with complex data transfers or simply want to keep a close eye on your Linux system's processes, Pipeviewer is your go-to tool for process monitoring and I/O analysis.

Yeah, this is basically `pv` progress monitor tool writen in rust, all be writen in rust hahaha.
